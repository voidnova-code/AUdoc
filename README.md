# 🏥 AUdoc — Campus Healthcare Portal

### *Because "I Googled my symptoms" is NOT a treatment plan.*
### *(And because voidnova got tired of students calling the health center like it's 1995)*

**The official campus health management system for Assam University Silchar — built by someone who actually cares**

## 🩺 What Is AUdoc?

**Tired of wandering the hallways looking for the campus doctor while feeling like death warmed over?**

Welcome to the 21st century. 🚀

AUdoc is a full-stack **campus healthcare management system** built for **Assam University Silchar** by someone (voidnova) who realized that making students call the health center on a landline was objectively criminal.

**Features that'll make you wonder why we didn't have this sooner:**
- 📅 Book doctor appointments without a phone call
- 🩸 Donate blood (be a hero, but digitally)
- 💬 AI Chatbot that actually helps (unlike WebMD, which will convince you that you're dying)
- 💸 Donate money to the health center (even ₹10 counts!)
- 📊 Check your appointment history without asking a human

> *"A student needed to book a doctor appointment. The existing system was... a phone call. In 2025.*  
> *No further questions. voidnova took this personally."* — Internal memo, circa 2024

The system has two layers working together:
- 🐍 **Django Web Backend** — Fully functional, actually works, no "brb coffee break" 
- 📱 **Flutter Mobile App** — Beautiful UI that'll make you forget you're sick (almost)

---

## 🔐 How the Auth Flow Works

```
  Student                     System                     Admin (voidnova)
    │                            │                          │
    │──── Enter Student ID ─────>│                          │
    │<─── OTP sent to email ─────│                          │ ← This is why your inbox is flooded
    │──── Enter OTP ────────────>│ (rate limited + secure)  │
    │<─── Logged in! ────────────│                          │
    │                            │                          │
    │   (First time? Register!)  │                          │
    │──── Fill reg form ────────>│                          │
    │     + email OTP verify     │                          │
    │                            │──── Pending queue ──────>│ ← voidnova reads this
    │                            │<─── Approve/Reject ───────│ ← voidnova approves this
    │<─── Welcome email! ────────│  (auto-provisions account)│
```

**No passwords.** No "Forgot password?" links at 2 AM. Just vibes and OTPs. ✌️

> 🔒 **Security Note:** OTPs are generated using cryptographically secure random numbers, validated with constant-time comparison (timing-attack resistant), and rate-limited so brute force attackers give up out of sheer frustration.

---

## 🔒 Security *(Because We're Not Monsters)*

AUdoc takes security seriously. The application has been hardened against common web vulnerabilities because voidnova doesn't want to wake up at 3 AM to a data breach notification.

### Security Features

| Feature | Protection Against | Status | voidnova's Confidence Level |
|---------|-------------------|--------|--------------------------|
| 🛡️ **Rate Limiting** | Brute force attacks on login/OTP | ✅ Active | 9/10 (unless someone is REALLY persistent) |
| 🔐 **Secure OTP** | Cryptographically secure random generation | ✅ Active | 10/10 (Python's `secrets` module ftw) |
| ⏱️ **Timing Attack Protection** | Constant-time OTP comparison | ✅ Active | 10/10 (zero nanoseconds given to attackers) |
| 🚫 **SQL Injection** | Parameterized queries via Django ORM | ✅ Protected | 10/10 (Django does the heavy lifting) |
| 🔄 **CSRF Protection** | All state-changing operations require tokens | ✅ Active | 10/10 (automatic, because voidnova is lazy) |
| 🍪 **Secure Cookies** | HttpOnly, SameSite, Secure flags | ✅ Active | 10/10 (cookies are actually secure) |
| 🔒 **Security Headers** | X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, XSS filter | ✅ Active | 9/10 (some configs are still evolving) |
| 🔑 **Argon2 Hashing** | Memory-hard password hashing algorithm | ✅ Active | 10/10 (even quantum computers will struggle) |
| 📝 **Security Logging** | Failed login attempts, rate limit violations | ✅ Active | 8/10 (logs are there, but who reads them?) |

### Rate Limits *(To Stop You From Breaking Things)*

| Endpoint | Limit | Window | Why? |
|----------|-------|--------|------|
| OTP Send | 5 requests | 5 minutes | So you don't spam your inbox with OTPs |
| Login | 10 requests | 5 minutes | Attackers give up. We've seen it happen. |
| API | 100 requests | 1 minute | Be nice to the server. It has feelings. |

### Security Configuration *(DO THIS OR SAYAN WILL CRY)*

For production deployment, ensure these environment variables are set:

```env
# Security (REQUIRED for production — trust us)
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=<generate-strong-random-key-seriously-not-password123>
DJANGO_DEBUG=False              # If you set this to True in production, we WILL judge you
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com
DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True
```

> 📄 For complete security documentation, see [`AUdoc_back/SECURITY.md`](AUdoc_back/SECURITY.md)
>
> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Generate your SECRET_KEY with `python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"` — not with "password123"

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites *(No Excuses)*

Make sure you have these installed — no "I don't have Python" allowed:

- 🐍 **Python 3.12+** — [python.org](https://python.org) — If you don't have it, your computer is outdated
- 🐦 **Flutter 3.x** — [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) — Optional if you only want the web version
- 📧 **Gmail with App Password** — [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) — No, you can't use your main password (don't be silly)
- **Git** — You clearly already have it if you're reading this 😄

---

### 🐍 Backend Setup (Django) *(The Actual Work Begins)*

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/voidnova-code/AUdoc.git
cd AUdoc/AUdoc_back

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate      # Windows (if you're one of those people)
source myenv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux (the superior choice)

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set up your secrets
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in your Django secret key + Gmail credentials
# (Yes, that DJANGO_SECRET_KEY thing is important. Very important.)

# 5. Apply database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# 6. Create a superuser (for the admin panel)
python manage.py createsuperuser
# Username: admin
# Password: Make it stronger than "password123"

# 7. Start the server!
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit 👉 `http://127.0.0.1:8000` — if you see a page, congratulations. You didn't break anything.

Admin panel 👉 `http://127.0.0.1:8000/manage/` (Modern UI designed by voidnova who probably needs sleep)

Django admin 👉 `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` (The boring one, but it works)

---

### 📱 Flutter App Setup

```bash
cd AUdoc/audoc

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on your connected device or emulator
flutter run
```

---

### 🔑 Environment Variables

Create the file `AUdoc_back/.env` (it's in `.gitignore`, your secrets are safe):

#### For Development (SQLite):
```env
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-super-long-random-secret-key-here
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key_here
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_for_chatbot
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret
```

#### For Production (PostgreSQL on Render):
```env
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-super-long-random-secret-key-here
DJANGO_DEBUG=False
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key_here
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_for_chatbot
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit `.env` to git.** It's gitignored for a reason. We are not animals.
>
> 💡 **Resend API Key:** Get it from [resend.com/api-keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)
>
> 💡 **Groq API Key:** Get free tier at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

## 🎛️ Modern Admin Panel

The admin panel has been completely redesigned with a modern glass-morphism UI!

### ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎨 **Glass-morphism UI** | Modern translucent interface with backdrop blur |
| 🌗 **Dark/Light Mode** | Toggle button with smooth transitions |
| 📊 **Interactive Charts** | Line charts & doughnut charts with real data |
| 📈 **Real-time Stats** | Auto-refresh every 30 seconds |

## 🎭 Custom Error Pages

### 404 & 500 Error Pages

AUdoc features custom, creatively-styled error pages designed as **"AUdoc Incident Reports"**:

| Error | Features | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **404 Not Found** | Animated incident descriptions, randomized messages, redacted text (click to reveal) | ✅ Live |
| **500 Server Error** | Same creative styling as 404 for consistent branding | ✅ Live |

### Error Page Features

- 📋 **Official Incident Report Style** — Styled like a bureaucratic form letter
- 🎬 **Animated Content** — Incident descriptions rotate every 5 seconds with smooth fade transitions
- 🔓 **Interactive Elements** — Redacted text reveals on hover with quirky messages
- 🎨 **Visual Details** — Includes tape, paperclip, and official stamp for immersion
- ⌚ **Dynamic Data** — Shows current date/time and randomized file paths
- 🏠 **Quick Actions** — "Return to Base" and "Browse Archives" buttons for navigation

### How It Works

```
User visits non-existent URL
    ↓
Django triggers 404/500 error handler
    ↓
Custom page_404/page_500 views render 404.html template
    ↓
User sees creative incident report (and smiles)
```

## ⏰ Scheduled Tasks (Today's Appointments)

The system supports automated daily appointment confirmations:

### How It Works

1. **8:00 AM** — System sends confirmation emails to patients with appointments today
2. **2-Hour Window** — Patients accept or decline via email link
3. **FCFS Queue** — Confirmed patients get queue positions (First Come, First Serve)
4. **Midnight** — Old records are cleaned up automatically

### Setup (Windows Task Scheduler)

```bash
# Send confirmations at 8 AM

## ⚠️ Important Notes *(Read This Or Your Setup Will Break)*

- **Development:** Uses **SQLite** for quick setup (not recommended for production unless you want catastrophic failure)
- **Production:** Uses **PostgreSQL** on Render (auto-configured via `DATABASE_URL` — you're welcome)
- **Email:** Powered by **Resend** (free tier with custom domain support)
  - Use `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing (it works, trust us)
  - Add your domain in Resend dashboard for production (yes, you have to do this)
- **AI Chatbot:** Uses **Groq API** (free tier, `llama-3.1-8b-instant` model — it's not GPT-4, but it's free)
- **Custom Error Pages:** 404/500 errors display creative incident report-style pages (actually makes errors fun)
- **DEBUG = True** is development-only. Set it to `False` in production, or wake up to a security audit.
- The `myenv/` folder is gitignored. Always create your own virtual environment. (voidnova is tired of debugging envs)
- The Flutter app is a **UI prototype** — backend integration with DRF is in progress (voidnova is working on it, give him a break)
- The modern admin panel is at `/manage/`, not `/admin/`. (We know it's confusing)
- Doctor profile photos are stored in `media/doctors/`. (Yes, they're real photos, not Lorem Ipsum)
- **Never commit `.env`** — it contains secrets and is gitignored. If you commit secrets, voidnova will find you. 👀

## 🤝 Contributing *(Help voidnova Stay Awake)*

Contributions are welcome! Found a bug? Have a cool idea? Here's the drill:

```
1. Fork the repo (steal it, but legally)
2. Create your branch:   git checkout -b feat/amazing-feature
3. Commit your changes:  git commit -m "Add some amazing feature"
4. Push to your branch:  git push origin feat/amazing-feature
5. Open a Pull Request   (voidnova will review it eventually)
```

> **Pro Tips:**
> - Write a meaningful PR description. "fixed stuff" will be gently mocked. 😄
> - Don't commit your `.env` file. We've all been there. We've learned. Move on. 🙈
> - If you fix a bug, buy voidnova a coffee (UPI accepted)
