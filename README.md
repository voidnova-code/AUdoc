## 🩺 What Is AUdoc?

Tired of wandering the hallways looking for the campus doctor while feeling like death warmed over?
**AUdoc has got you covered** — literally.

AUdoc is a full-stack **campus healthcare management system** built for **Assam University Silchar**. From booking doctor appointments to donating blood (heroically), AUdoc is the one-stop-shop for all your campus health needs. No WebMD rabbit holes. No self-diagnosis spirals at 2am. Just real doctors, real appointments, and real OTPs delivered to your inbox.

> *"A student needed to book a doctor appointment. The existing system was... a phone call. In 2025.*
> *No further questions."* — So we built this. You're welcome.

The system has two layers working together:
- 🐍 **Django Web Backend** — Fully functional healthcare portal (the real deal)
- 📱 **Flutter Mobile App** — Polished cross-platform UI prototype (the superstar in training)

## 🔐 How the Auth Flow Works

```
  Student                     System                     Admin
    │                            │                          │
    │──── Enter Student ID ─────>│                          │
    │<─── OTP sent to email ─────│                          │
    │──── Enter OTP ────────────>│ (rate limited + secure)  │
    │<─── Logged in! ────────────│                          │
    │                            │                          │
    │   (First time? Register!)  │                          │
    │──── Fill reg form ────────>│                          │
    │     + email OTP verify     │                          │
    │                            │──── Pending queue ──────>│

    │<─── Welcome email! ────────│  (auto-provisions account)│
```

No passwords. No "Forgot password?" links. Just vibes and OTPs. ✌️

> 🔒 **Security Note:** OTPs are generated using cryptographically secure random numbers, validated with constant-time comparison (timing-attack resistant), and all endpoints are rate-limited.

---

## 🔒 Security

AUdoc takes security seriously. The application has been hardened against common web vulnerabilities:

### Security Features

| Feature | Protection Against | Status |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| 🛡️ **Rate Limiting** | Brute force attacks on login/OTP endpoints | ✅ Active |

| ⏱️ **Timing Attack Protection** | Constant-time OTP comparison | ✅ Active |
| 🚫 **SQL Injection** | Parameterized queries via Django ORM | ✅ Protected |
| 🔄 **CSRF Protection** | All state-changing operations require tokens | ✅ Active |
| 🍪 **Secure Cookies** | HttpOnly, SameSite, Secure flags | ✅ Active |
| 🔒 **Security Headers** | X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, XSS filter | ✅ Active |
| 🔑 **Argon2 Hashing** | Memory-hard password hashing algorithm | ✅ Active |
| 📝 **Security Logging** | Failed login attempts, rate limit violations | ✅ Active |

### Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Limit | Window |
|----------|-------|--------|
| OTP Send | 5 requests | 5 minutes |
| Login | 10 requests | 5 minutes |
| API | 100 requests | 1 minute |

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed — no excuses:

- 🐍 **Python 3.12+** — [python.org](https://python.org)
- 🐦 **Flutter 3.x** — [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- 📧 **Gmail with App Password** — [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
- **Git** — you clearly already have it if you're reading this 😄

---

### 🐍 Backend Setup (Django)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/voidnova-code/AUdoc.git
cd AUdoc/AUdoc_back

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
source myenv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set up your secrets
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in your Django secret key + Gmail credentials

# 5. Apply database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# 6. Create a superuser (for the admin panel)
python manage.py createsuperuser

# 7. Start the server!
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit 👉 `http://127.0.0.1:8000` — if you see a page, it worked. Celebrate responsibly. 🎉

Admin panel 👉 `http://127.0.0.1:8000/manage/` (Modern UI)

Django admin 👉 `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` (Default Django)

---

### 📱 Flutter App Setup

```bash
cd AUdoc/audoc

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on your connected device or emulator
flutter run
```

---

### 🔑 Environment Variables

Create the file `AUdoc_back/.env` (it's in `.gitignore`, your secrets are safe):

```env
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-super-long-random-secret-key-here
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=AUdoc Health Center <your-gmail@gmail.com>
SITE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit `.env` to git.** It's gitignored for a reason. We are not animals.
>
> 💡 **Gmail App Password:** Go to Google Account → Security → App Passwords.
> Use your *real* Gmail password here and everyone will know what you did.

## 🎛️ Modern Admin Panel

The admin panel has been completely redesigned with a modern glass-morphism UI!

### ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎨 **Glass-morphism UI** | Modern translucent interface with backdrop blur |
| 🌗 **Dark/Light Mode** | Toggle button with smooth transitions |
| 📊 **Interactive Charts** | Line charts & doughnut charts with real data |
| 📈 **Real-time Stats** | Auto-refresh every 30 seconds |
| 🎫 **FCFS Queue View** | Today's appointments in queue order |
| 🔍 **Advanced Search** | Fast search with DataTables integration |
| 📱 **Mobile Responsive** | Works on all devices |

### Access

Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/manage/`

*(Staff/admin account required)*

---

## ⏰ Scheduled Tasks (Today's Appointments)

The system supports automated daily appointment confirmations:

### How It Works

1. **8:00 AM** — System sends confirmation emails to patients with appointments today
2. **2-Hour Window** — Patients accept or decline via email link
3. **FCFS Queue** — Confirmed patients get queue positions (First Come, First Serve)
4. **Midnight** — Old records are cleaned up automatically

### Setup (Windows Task Scheduler)

```bash
# Send confirmations at 8 AM
python manage.py send_appointment_confirmations

# Cleanup at midnight
python manage.py cleanup_todays_appointments
```

### Setup (Linux/macOS Cron)

```bash
# Add to crontab -e
0 8 * * * cd /path/to/AUdoc_back && python manage.py send_appointment_confirmations
0 0 * * * cd /path/to/AUdoc_back && python manage.py cleanup_todays_appointments
```

---

## 📋 Roadmap

- [x] ~~Flutter app ↔ Django REST API integration~~ ✅ DRF installed
- [x] ~~Modern admin panel with charts~~ ✅ Glass-morphism UI
- [x] ~~FCFS queue system~~ ✅ Today's Appointments
- [x] ~~AI Chatbot~~ ✅ Chat API endpoint
- [ ] Push notifications for appointment confirmations
- [ ] Prescription & medical history records
- [ ] PostgreSQL support for production
- [ ] Docker + CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Dark mode for student portal (admin has it! 🌑)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **SQLite** is used for development. Swap to **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** for production.
- `DEBUG = True` is development-only. Set it to `False` in production, or regret it deeply.
- The `myenv/` folder is gitignored. Always create your own virtual environment.
- The Flutter app is a **UI prototype** — backend integration with DRF is in progress.
- The modern admin panel is at `/manage/`, not `/admin/`.
- Doctor profile photos are stored in `media/doctors/`.
